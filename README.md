This project is an extension from my previous calculator project I completed a year ago.


I added new features
- If someone pays for the meal, then they are able to see a break-down of how much each person owes including tip(determined by user) and tax(7.75%)
-Better UI
  -Apple SF Pro Fonts
  -Standard Color scheme
  -Intuitive object layout

Upcoming Features
-User is able to add attributes to each person (name, what they ordered, how much their order costs)
-Fixing bug related to tableview scrolling
