This project is an extension from my previous calculator project I completed a year ago.


I added new features
1. If someone pays for the meal, then they are able to see a break-down of how much each person owes including tip(determined by user) and tax(7.75%)
2. Better UI
    * Apple SF Pro Fonts
    * Standard Color scheme
    * Intuitive object layout

Upcoming Features
1. User is able to add attributes to each person (name, what they ordered, how much their order costs)
2. Fixing bug related to tableview scrolling
